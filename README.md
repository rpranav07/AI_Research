![AI Research Program] Credits to [Harshit Tyagi](https://github.com/dswh)

An independent AI research program 
I am now embarking on a journey to learn the concepts of AI via this AI Research Program.

I have designed this program to be thorough, exciting, gamified and hands-on. The program also draws inspiration from various Research Engineer roles at companies like [OpenAI](https://openai.com/careers/research-engineer/), [Anthropic](https://boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4019739008), [Meta](https://www.metacareers.com/v2/jobs/2780884748740452/), and the likes.

The following curriculum is designed to help me get a deeper and thorough understanding of all important concepts in AI.

## My learning approach

Keep an eye on [weekly-notes](./weekly-notes) for my learnings and thoughts.

I'll dedicate at least 1 hours daily to my learning.

> ⚠️ This program is still under development and will be updated as I progress in my journey. Feel free to contribute to it by opening issues or suggesting improvements.

## How to consume this?
- Beginners should start with the [Foundational Knowledge](#pillar-1-foundational-knowledge) section.
- For all others who have some exposure to ML/DL, tweak the curriculum as per your level of understanding.
- This curriculum is not supposed to be consumed in a linear fashion. Treat it more like a checklist. 
- You should start with the basics and gradually move towards more complex topics as per your goals and interests.
