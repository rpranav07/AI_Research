## My Learning Approach

This program is designed to give me a deep, thorough understanding of AI concepts, from the basics to advanced research. My approach emphasizes:
- **Hands-on coding**: Focusing on real-world applications.
- **Project-based learning**: Building projects at every stage to cement my understanding.
- **Foundational knowledge**: Revisiting core concepts to ensure a solid base.
